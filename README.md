# Section 2 : Version Control System

## Web portfolio
- index.html -> about.html

## Version Control System
- Version Control is a <ins>**manager software**</ins> responsible for **managing chnages** to the computer programs, doc, websites & other collection of info.
- Easy recovery of files/folders
- Rollback to the previous versions
- Informs about who, what, when, why changes have been made

## History of VCS - Evolution
1. **Local VCS**
   - Changes are stored in a database, along with timestamp
   - Code in local system
   - Cons -> Project can be lost, if your hard-disk is corrupted
     
2. **Centralize VCS**
   - **Repository** -> A directory(folder) where your files reside
   - Repository can be a local folder in your PC or a remote folder on a server
   - There are 2 types of repository :-
     1. Local Repository
     2. Central Repository
    
   - Centralized VCS contain just one repository i.e Central repository and each user can access it to work
   - Cons -> Server goes down then nobody can work + if server hard-disk corrupt

3. **Distributed VCS**
   - Contains multiple repositories, each users has their own local repository & there is a central repository where the final code resides
   - push & pull to/from central repository by each users
   - provide full back-up of the project, all users will have full project
   - eg: Git is an example of distributed vcs
   - n local repositories --push-->.....<--pull-- 1 server repository
   - Everyone uses this Distributed VCS
  
## How is Git created?
- In 2005, by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux Kernel on which many OS created like ubuntu,kali linex etc)

## What is Git?
- **free and open source** distributed VCS designed to handle everything from mini to macro projects ***with speed & efficiency***
- Stores snapshot of your project (not differences)

## Why Git & its Features
- Why Git -> **{ 1.Collaboration, 2.Storing Versions, 3.Analyse Code Changes }**
- Features -> **{ 1.Distributed, 2.Everything is Locally, 3.Non-linear/Branching, 4.Secure/Integrity(Hashing), 5.Speed(C) }**


# Section 3 : Setting Up Environment

## Installing Git
